            <h1>Cybersecurity and Forensics</h1>
        <p>
    
            A 4 year course in order <br>
            to complete with various opportunities within year 3 of even a full <br>
             year of a placement.  As it’s a full-time course, don’t be mislead by <br>
             only 3 days of scheduled classes. This doesn’t mean 4 days of relaxing <br>
             and enjoying student life. Technology is great, inspirational with endless<br> 
             limits but this course will show you a little different look on things<br>
             as well as how to avoid some consequences in regards to security. <br>
             I am not making it sound exciting, am I?

        <p style="text-align:center;"> Lets have a look at some facts related to the cyber security</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align:center;"> Cyber crime is quickly becoming more profitable than the illegal drug trade.<br>
            <br>
            
            Most attackers target small business – yes this may not mean the attacker will <br>end up with a fortune 
            but with little security of small business, hacker will spend very little time planning and 
            <br>executing attack. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-34647780">Here</a> is a local example from 2015</p>
            <p style="text-align:center;">The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) responsible for environmental <br>
                updates and protection such as flooding, has also been a victim of a cyber security<br>
                 attack which had more than  4,000 digital files stolen during the incident.<br>
                 Details of this 
                 attack can be found <a href=
                 "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-59054590#:~:text=Hackers%20responsible%20for%20a%20cyber%20attack%20on%20Scotland%27s,than%204%2C000%20digital%20files%20stolen%20in%20the%20incident">

            <br>
            <p style="text-align:center;">British Airways have been fined £20 millions for data breach affecting more <br>
                than 400,000 customers. In 2018 BA have been victims of cyber attack which was undetected for 2 months. <br>
                Why would a company who fell as a victim to cyber crime have to pay a fine?<br><a href=
