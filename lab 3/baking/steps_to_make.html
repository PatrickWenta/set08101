<header><b>Step 1</b></hr>
<p>Gather the ingredients. Preheat oven to 350 F.</p>
<header><b> Step 2</b></hr>
<p>Butter and flour two 9-inch cake pans. The cakes will release better if the bottoms of pans are lined with a circle of parchment paper. </p>
<header><b> Step 3</b></hr>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, sift flour, sugar, and cocoa powder. Add salt, baking powder, and baking soda, and whisk until everything is blended.</p>
<header><b> Step 4</b></hr>
<p>In a separate mixing bowl, combine milk, eggs, oil, and vanilla, and whisk to combine. Then whisk in boiling water. </p>
<header><b> Step 5</b></hr>
<p>Add wet ingredients to dry and stir until combined.</p>
<header><b> Step 6</b></hr>
<p>Pour batter into prepared pans and transfer to oven.</p>
<header><b> Step 7</b></hr>
<p>Bake for about 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, or with a crumb or two attached. Start testing after 27 minutes to avoid over-baking.</p>
<header><b> Step 8</b></hr>
<p>Cool cakes for 10 minutes in pans on a wire rack. Loosen edges by running a knife along sides, turn cakes out onto racks, and cool for at least another hour.</p>
<header><b> Step 9</b></hr>
<p>Once cool, you can trim your cakes to be more level, eating any scraps or keep as is. Place one layer on a cake stand, then cover with a layer of frosting. Place the second layer, top side-down on the buttercream. Finish the cake with the remaining buttercream, as desired.</p>
